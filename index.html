<a href="/about"><h2>About</h2></a>

I received my PhD from the <a href="https://www.asc.upenn.edu/people/students/devon-brackbill">University of Pennsylvania</a>, where my research focused on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_social_science">Computational Social Science</a> as part of the <a href="http://ndg.asc.upenn.edu/">Network Dynamics Group</a> with <a href="http://ndg.asc.upenn.edu/damon-centola/">Damon Centola</a>.

<a href="/research"><h2>Research</h2></a>

My research sits at the intersection of physics, computer science, and the social sciences. I am interested in how individual actions give rise to collective phenomena in large populations. Applications include the complex interplay of social forces that produce <b>collective intelligence</b>, <b>group problem-solving</b>, and <b>consensus formation</b> in human social systems. 
<br><br>
To understand the dynamics of such systems, I rely on agent-based models to gain theoretical traction on a social behavior. Then, I test these ideas using online experiments to see if these theories hold true.

<a href="/projects"><h2>Data Science</h2></a>

I am currently a data scientist at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/devonbrackbill">Cooper Health</a>, where I implement predictive models and advanced analytics to help drive down the cost of health coverage and deliver treatment to the sickest patients.
<br><br>
I have several data science projects using machine learning, and I was a fellow with <a href="http://insightdatascience.com/">Insight Data Science</a>. See my <a href="/projects">Data Science Projects</a> for more information.
