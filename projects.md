*Can machine learning make us healthier?*

As a fellow in <a href=http://www.insightdatascience.com>Insight Data Science</a>, I built an app that predicts severe health violations  in Boston restaurants. Using a unique data set from Yelp and the city of Boston, I used natural language processing (NLP) techniques to encode the textual data. I implemented several models, including a random forest and gradient boosted trees. I also visualized the model's predictions with an interactive map of the city. You can view the code for the models on <a href=https://github.com/devonbrackbill/project_nspectr>Github</a>. I have taken down the website.

<br>
Tools: Python, R.
<br><br>
Skills: Implemented tf-idf in Python and cleaned up all the text data before building several machine learning models to predict severe violations.

I have competed in several Kaggle competitions, including classifying purchase decisions for insurance in the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/homesite-quote-conversion">Homesite Quote Conversion Challenge</a>, quantifying property hazards in the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/liberty-mutual-group-property-inspection-prediction">Liberty Mutual Group Challenge</a>, and classifying products in the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/otto-group-product-classification-challenge">Otto Group Classification Challenge</a>, placing in the top 13%, 15%, and 18%, respectively, out of thousands of competitors.

## Social Media and Fitness

*Can a social media site help you go to the gym?*

Marketers wonder if online clicks can lead to offline behavior. To answer this question, we built a social media site as part of a fitness program that enrolled more than 1,000 graduate and professional students at UPenn. We <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211335515001072">found</a> that social influence from peers in an online social media site was more effective at getting people to show up to fitness classes than traditional online advertisement messages. In a follow-up study, we examined which aspects of social influence were most effective on the social media site. The results have implications for the design of online web platforms to promote offline behavior change.

## [Deciding Where to Move](../projects/MovingDecision.html)

*Using data science to inform our moving decision*

<div class="floating-box">

When we were deciding where to relocate to, we wanted to make an informed decision. The weather is really important to me (Seasonal Affective Disorder is a real thing!). But we also wanted information about commuting times, the price of housing, and taxes. I built a web scraper to gather information about our locations, and then made some charts in R to help our decision.
<br><br>
Tools: Python, R.
<br><br>
Skills: Implements a complete data pipeline from gathering information on the web with Python, to storing it, and then processing it in R, and generating plots and an html output document <a href="../projects/MovingDecision.html">available here</a>.

Code is available on <a href="https://github.com/devonbrackbill/MovingDecision">Github</a>.

## The Tipping Point

*When do products take off?*

The search for a tipping point has vexed marketers and social movements alike. This project examines several simulations to show how the number of initial adherents to a product or cause influences its adoption rate.
<br>
<br>
Code for these simulations is available on <a href="https://github.com/devonbrackbill/CommittedMinorities">Github</a>.
