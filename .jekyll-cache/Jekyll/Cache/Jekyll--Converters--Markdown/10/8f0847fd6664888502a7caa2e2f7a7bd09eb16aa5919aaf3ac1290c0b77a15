As a fellow in &lt;a href=http://www.insightdatascience.com&gt;Insight Data Science&lt;/a&gt;, I built an app that predicts severe health violations  in Boston restaurants. Using a unique data set from Yelp and the city of Boston, I used natural language processing (NLP) techniques to encode the textual data. I implemented several models, including a random forest and gradient boosted trees. I also visualized the model's predictions with an interactive map of the city. You can view the code for the models on &lt;a href=https://github.com/devonbrackbill/project_nspectr&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;. I have taken down the website.

<br />
Tools: Python, R.
<br /><br />
Skills: Implemented tf-idf in Python and cleaned up all the text data before building several machine learning models to predict severe violations.

<p><em>When do products and norms take off?</em></p>

The search for a tipping point has vexed marketers and social movements alike. This project examines several simulations to show how the number of initial adherents to a product or cause influences its adoption rate. It represents some early theoretical thinking that eventually led to our paper in <i>Science</i> on <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6393/1116">"Experimental evidence for tipping points in social convention."</a>
<br />
<br />
Code for these simulations is available on <a href="https://github.com/devonbrackbill/CommittedMinorities">Github</a>.

<p><em>Can a social media site help you go to the gym?</em></p>

<p><img height="auto" width="150px" style="float: left; margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;" src="/img/fitness.png" /></p>

<p>Marketers wonder if online clicks can lead to offline behavior. To answer this question, we built a social media site as part of a fitness program that enrolled more than 1,000 graduate and professional students at UPenn. We <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211335515001072">found</a> that social influence from peers in an online social media site was more effective at getting people to show up to fitness classes than traditional online advertisement messages. In a follow-up study, we examined which aspects of social influence were most effective on the social media site. The results have implications for the design of online web platforms to promote offline behavior change.</p>

<p><em>Using data science to inform our moving decision</em></p>

<div class="floating-box">

<img height="auto" width="150px" style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 0px 0px;" src="/img/moving.jpg" />

When we were deciding where to relocate to, we wanted to make an informed decision. The weather is really important to me (Seasonal Affective Disorder is a real thing!). But we also wanted information about commuting times, the price of housing, and taxes. I built a web scraper to gather information about our locations, and then made some charts in R to help our decision.
<br /><br />
Tools: Python, R.
<br /><br />
Skills: Implements a complete data pipeline from gathering information on the web with Python, to storing it, and then processing it in R, and generating plots and an html output document <a href="../projects/MovingDecision.html">available here</a>.

Code is available on <a href="https://github.com/devonbrackbill/MovingDecision">Github</a>.
