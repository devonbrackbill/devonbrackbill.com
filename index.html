I earned my PhD from the <a href="https://www.asc.upenn.edu/people/students/devon-brackbill">University of Pennsylvania</a>, where my research focused on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_social_science">Computational Social Science</a> as part of the <a href="http://ndg.asc.upenn.edu/">Network Dynamics Group</a>. My <a href='academic-research'>research</a> has been published in <i>Science</i>, <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i>, and elsewhere.

I am currently a data scientist at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/devonbrackbill">Facebook</a>, where I work on integrity problems for Instagram.

My research sits at the intersection of the social sciences, physics, and computer science. I am interested in how individual actions give rise to collective phenomena in large populations. Applications include the complex interplay of social forces that produce <b>collective intelligence</b>, <b>group problem-solving</b>, <b>consensus formation</b>, and <b>social norms</b> in human social systems. 
<br><br>
To understand the dynamics of such systems, I rely on agent-based models to gain theoretical traction on a social behavior. Then, I test these ideas using online experiments to see if these theories hold true.
