I earned my PhD from the University of Pennsylvania, where I was a member of the <a href="http://ndg.asc.upenn.edu/">Network Dynamics Group</a>. My <a href='academic-research'>academic research</a> in Computational Social Science has been published in <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6393/1116"><i>Science</i></a>, <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/06/06/1615978114.abstract"><i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i></a>, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0237978"><i>PLOS ONE</i></a>, and <a href="/academic-research">elsewhere</a>.

I am currently a data scientist at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/devonbrackbill">Amazon Robotics</a>, where I'm working on improving robotic fulfillment centers and expanding the delivery network that handles <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/2/16841786/amazon-prime-2017-users-ship-five-billion">billions of packages each year</a>.

I previously worked as a data scientist at Instagram, where I addressed site integrity problems, including the measurement and automated removal of objectionable content.

My research sits at the intersection of the social sciences, physics, and computer science. I am interested in how individual actions give rise to collective phenomena in large populations. Applications include the complex interplay of social forces that produce <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/06/06/1615978114.abstract"><b>collective intelligence</b></a>, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0237978"><b>group problem-solving</b></a>, <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6393/1116"><b>consensus formation</b></a>, and <b>social norms</b> in human social systems.
<br><br>
To understand the dynamics of such systems, I rely on agent-based models to gain theoretical traction on a social behavior. Then, I test these ideas using online experiments to see if these theories hold true.
